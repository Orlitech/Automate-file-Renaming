🌟 Magic BAT File for Auto-Renaming Files (Any File Type!) 🌟
Say goodbye to the tedious task of renaming files one by one! This magic BAT file is here to automate the process and save you loads of time. And the best part? It works for any type of file—not just images. 🧙‍♂️✨

Here’s how to use it:

Drop the BAT file into any folder (it can be a mix of files, images, documents—whatever you need!).
Right-click the file and change the name from "Title" to your own TITLE Name or any title you prefer (don’t worry, we won’t judge!).
Save the changes, and BOOM 🚀
From here on out, every time you run this magical BAT file, all the files in the folder will automatically be renamed based on your custom naming scheme.
It’s like having a wizard in your computer that handles your file renaming! No more manual renaming—just a seamless experience. 🎩💻
